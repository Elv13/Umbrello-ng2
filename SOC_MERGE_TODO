Flat todo list (in no particular order - some are new features,
  some are missing features)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Widget size vary considerably wrt trunk version..
   Fix is to hack on TextItem and TextItemGroup classes to eliminate the
   extra margin inherent in QGraphicsTextItem class.

2) Rock stable undo/redo system implementation.. All user visible changes
   should be undoable.

3) Modification handling (ask for save at right time..)
    Utilize undo/redo's functionality for this.

4) Ensure compatibility of older umbrello xmi files.

5) Fix export to XHTML, DOCBOOK and picture bugs..
   Fixing export to picture will automatically fix everything.

6) Fix print issue (very large ugly pdf's produced and reproducible in trunk)

7) Sane cut/copy/paste implementation.

8) Implement support for deletion and cloning of widgets.

9) Improve the working of Association widgets.
   (non angular line support, floating text widget position improvement)

10) Implement auto adjustment of diagram size.

11) Implement snap to grid feature.

12) Performance is terrible when grid is visible.. Optimize this.

13) Implement user option to choose text colour of widgets.
    The variables and methods are already in place, just a user visible
    setting option is requried.

14) Increase max size of widget, as QSizeF(1000, 1000) is the current limit.

15) Fix the selection behavior when large hollow widget (Ex BoxWidget)
    surrounds a set of smaller widgets, the smaller widgets aren't selectable
    as the focus is stolen by the larger wigdet.

16) The alignment of text in all widgets should be restored back to TopLeft.

17) Fix incosistencies of text attributes (bold, italics etc) of all widgets.

18) Fix the bug, where package name in classifierwidget isn't updated on
    renaming packagewidget to which the classifierwidget belongs.

19) MessageWidget, ObjectWidget behavior to be perfected still. (in progress)

20) Some widgets in State diagram are inconsistent with that of trunk
    (state's round rect, end state, fork/join and their resizable constraint)

21) The "exception" association shape requires implemention of 'Z' shape
    constraint.

22) Check whether AcceptTimeEvent widget's text (Activity diagram) should be
    made floating text widget or not.

23) The line separating state in Objectnode with type = ObjectFlow should be
    90% and centred.

24) Check whether aspect ratio is to be constrained for Artifact widget.

25) Check/implement constraints on entity in Entity relationship diagram.

26) Ensure working of code generation, auto associations.. etc.
