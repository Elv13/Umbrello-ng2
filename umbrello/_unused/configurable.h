 * line tools and plugins. These classes define common subsets of functionality
 * these objects. Primarily, these classes provide application support for
 * features such as configurability and plugin management. Also provided
 * within this API are the core interfaces for GUI management.

 * The Configurable class is the base class of all functional objects that
 * can be created for modeling applications. There are three types of
 * functionality: applications (with GUIs), command line tools and plugins.
 * This class provides a common configuration interface that the functional
 * classes use for default configuration and plugin management. Although
 * the Configurable class is primarily an interface it does provide some
 * convenience methods that can be used by derived classes to help manage
 * plugins. These methods are conceptually part of a larger (althought
 * currently undefined) set of configuration helper methods that reduce
 * the amount of code duplication for applications, tools and plugins.
 *
 * At this time, this class only assists with the configuration of the
 * event-driven plugin management system. All interfaces and convenience
 * methods support the hidden configuration functionality for derived
 * classes.
 *
 * @todo Do we have to delete the plugin object when its unloaded? Is it
 * possible that we can just unload the library and created objects are
 * automatically destroyed? I need some clarification of what actually
 * happens here...
