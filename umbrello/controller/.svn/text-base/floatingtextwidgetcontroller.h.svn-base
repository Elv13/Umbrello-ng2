/**
 * Controller for FloatingTextWidget.
 *
 * When moving a FloatingTextWidget, it is constrained using constrainTextPos
 * method from the LinkWidget, if any.
 * This applies both when moving as part of a selection and when constraining
 * the move of the selection because it's the receiver of mouse move events.
 * The only exception to this is that when moving the widget, if it's a sequence
 * message and the message widget is selected, the floating text widget isn't
 * moved itself, but automatically by the message widget.
 * If the sequence message wasn't part of the selection, the floating text
 * widget moves it.
 * When moving the floating text as part of a selection, if the position of
 * the floating text is constrained, it's kept at that position until it can
 * be moved to another valid position.
 * No resize is allowed for FloatingTextWidget.
