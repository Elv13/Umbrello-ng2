/**
 * Controller for UMLWidget
 * This class takes care of user interaction with UMLWidgets: select, deselect,
 * move, resize...
 * Those actions are done using events. There are handlers for mousePressEvent,
 * mouseMoveEvent, mouseReleaseEvent and mouseDoubleClickEvent. There's more
 * information about each of them in their respective documentation.
 *
 * Behaviour of this class can be customized overriding the handlers themselves
 * (which isn't recommended) or, better, overriding the virtual protected
 * methods.
 *
 * The area that is considered as "resize area" can be customized with
 * isInResizeArea, so when there's a pressed button in this area, mouseMoveEvent
 * will resize the widget.
 * Also, if the resize area doesn't need to be modified, but the cursor to be
 * used when the mouse is in that area can be done with getResizeCursor.
 * When a widget is being resized, it's done using resizeWidget, so overriding
 * it makes possible to, for example, constrain the resizing only in one axis
 * no matter how the mouse was moved.
 *
 * Widget move can also be customized. The widgets are moved in mouseMoveEvent
 * using the moveWidgetBy method of the controller of each selected widget.
 * Overriding this method widget movement can be, for example, constrained to
 * an axis, no matter if the widget is being moved explicitly or as part of a
 * selection.
 * On the other hand, the move of all the selected widgets can be constrained
 * with constrainMovementForAllWidgets. This method, called in the controller
 * that is handling the mouseMoveEvent, modifies the difference between the
 * current position of the widgets and the new position to be moved to. For
 * example, if a widget shouldn't be moved in X axis, it's receiving the
 * mouseMoveEvents and there are other widgets selected, those other widgets
 * shouldn't be allowed either to be moved in X axis.
 *
 * The behaviour when double clicking on the widget after it's selected can be
 * customized with doMouseDoubleClick.
