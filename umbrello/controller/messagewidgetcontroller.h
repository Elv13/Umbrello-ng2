/**
 * Controller for MessageWidget.
 *
 * When moving a MessageWidget, it is only moved along Y axis. X axis movement
 * is always ignored.
 * So, if the MessageWidget is being moved as part of a selection and that
 * selection is moved in X and/or Y axis, the MessageWidget will only move in
 * Y axis. Another constrain is applied in Y axis, so the message doesn't pass
 * over the related object widgets. Due to this constrain, the vertical
 * position the message would have if it wasn't constrained is calculated, so
 * when the widget lowers the position where it was constrained it begins to
 * move again.
 * Also, when constraining the move of the selection because the receiver of
 * mouse move events is a MessageWidget, all the widgets are moved only in Y
 * axis. Another constrain is applied in Y axis, so the message doesn't pass
 * over the related object widgets. The unconstrained position isn't need here,
 * because the message widget is the receiver of the events, so when the cursor
 * goes lower than where it was constrained it begins to lower automatically.
 *
 * Creation messages take care of moving the object created when they're moved.
 *
 * Only vertical resize is allowed for MessageWidget. Cursor is set to reflect
 * this.
 *
 * Double click shows the dialog to select the operation of the message.
